# Everybody Codes 2024

Code and solutions for [Everbody Codes 2024](https://everybody.codes/event/2024/quests).

The code relating to each quest is held in its own folder within this repository.

Each quest has three parts parts to it. I've broken the solutions for each part out into their own individual python files just for clarity.
